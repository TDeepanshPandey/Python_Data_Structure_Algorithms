### Array Problems - 
1. **Anagram Check** - Given two strings, check to see if they are anagrams. An anagram is when the two strings can be written using the exact same letters (so you can just rearrange the letters to get a different phrase or word). 
2. **Array Pair Sum** - Given an integer array, output all the *unique* pairs that sum up to a specific value **k**.
3. **Find the Missing Element** - Consider an array of non-negative integers. A second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random element. Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the second array.
4. **Largest Continuous Sum** - Given an array of integers (positive and negative) find the largest continuous sum. 
5. **Sentence Reversal** - Given a string of words, reverse all the words.
6. **String Compression** - Given a string in the form 'AAAABBBBCCCCCDDEEEE' compress it to become 'A4B4C5D2E4'. For this problem, you can falsely "compress" strings of single or double letters. For instance, it is okay for 'AAB' to return 'A2B1' even though this technically takes more space.
7. **Unique Characters in String** - Given a string,determine if it is compreised of all unique characters. For example, the string 'abcde' has all unique characters and should return True. The string 'aabcde' contains duplicate characters and should return false.

### Stacks
1. **Implement a stack** - Try your best to implement your own stack! It should have the methods:
    * Check if its empty
    * Push a new item
    * Pop an item
    * Peek at the top item
    * Return the size
2. **Implement a queue** - A queue class should be able to do this:
    * Check if Queue is Empty
    * Enqueue
    * Dequeue
    * Return the size of the Queue
3. **Implement a Deque** - A Deque class with the following methods:
    * Check if its empty
    * Add to both front and rear
    * Remove from Front and Rear
    * Check the Size
4. **Balanced Parenthesis Check** - Given a string of opening and closing parentheses, check whether it’s balanced. We have 3 types of parentheses: round brackets: (), square brackets: [], and curly brackets: {}. Assume that the string doesn’t contain any other character than these, no spaces words or numbers. As a reminder, balanced parentheses require every opening parenthesis to be closed in the reverse order opened. For example ‘([])’ is balanced but ‘([)]’ is not.
