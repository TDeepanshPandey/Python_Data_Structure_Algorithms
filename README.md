### Array Problems - 
1. **Anagram Check** - Given two strings, check to see if they are anagrams. An anagram is when the two strings can be written using the exact same letters (so you can just rearrange the letters to get a different phrase or word). 
2. **Array Pair Sum** - Given an integer array, output all the *unique* pairs that sum up to a specific value **k**.
3. **Find the Missing Element** - Consider an array of non-negative integers. A second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random element. Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the second array.
4. **Largest Continuous Sum** - Given an array of integers (positive and negative) find the largest continuous sum. 
5. **Sentence Reversal** - Given a string of words, reverse all the words.
