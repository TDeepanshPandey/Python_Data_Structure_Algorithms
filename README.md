### Array Problems - 
1. **Anagram Check** - Given two strings, check to see if they are anagrams. An anagram is when the two strings can be written using the exact same letters (so you can just rearrange the letters to get a different phrase or word). 
2. **Array Pair Sum** - Given an integer array, output all the *unique* pairs that sum up to a specific value **k**.
3. **Find the Missing Element** - Consider an array of non-negative integers. A second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random element. Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the second array.
4. **Largest Continuous Sum** - Given an array of integers (positive and negative) find the largest continuous sum. 
5. **Sentence Reversal** - Given a string of words, reverse all the words.
6. **String Compression** - Given a string in the form 'AAAABBBBCCCCCDDEEEE' compress it to become 'A4B4C5D2E4'. For this problem, you can falsely "compress" strings of single or double letters. For instance, it is okay for 'AAB' to return 'A2B1' even though this technically takes more space.
7. **Unique Characters in String** - Given a string,determine if it is compreised of all unique characters. For example, the string 'abcde' has all unique characters and should return True. The string 'aabcde' contains duplicate characters and should return false.
